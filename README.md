# Gesture-recognition-using-Naive-Bayes-python-
Using Naive Bayes to recognize gestures, the program is made up of three parts
1) use the GUI to select a regoin of interest(roi) and use the roi to take pictures of gestures that you would like to use 
2) use the mixer to mix the images before classifying them
3) use the classifier to fit the naive bayes classifier
